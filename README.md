# Database-design-of-e-commerce-database---PostgreSQL
• Structured a database for an e-commerce website’s data in BCNF with fully identified entity relationships<br> • Identified and implemented the required constraints.<br>  • Executed advanced SQL queries(triggers, functions, etc) to identify the top-performing products, sellers and  marketing leads in the data

#### Introduction of project and dataset
Databases play a crucial role in our day-to-day life. We interact with different databases 
regularly while using the banking system, online shopping, etc. Databases are used to store, 
manage, access, and analyze vast amounts of data gathered from various sources. Databases can 
be thought of as a collection of well-organized structured data that can be analyzed to help 
businesses and enterprises understand their historical performance, target audience, and predict 
future scope to make well-informed business decisions.
 In this project, we are using a database that has a collection of past data of an Ecommerce website that has details about customers, products, transactions, sellers, and reviews 
of various products which are listed on the website along with data of marketing funnel which 
can help us understand the performance of the company from a marketing perspective.
The data that will be used in this project is publicly available data provided by Olist Store, a
Brazilian e-commerce company that connects small businesses through its online platform. The 
dataset contains information about orders made on Olist from 2016 to 2018. The goal of the 
project is to understand the performance of sellers, the customer demographic for different 
product categories, customer satisfaction average of different sellers, marketing campaign 
conversions. This will be done by analyzing the data by performing queries like DDL and DML.
We chose a database over an excel file for this project since the database can be easily 
manipulated using DML queriers with high accuracy compared to an Excel file. The database 
also makes it easy to make updates across the tables simple, and a database is also much more 
secure compared to an excel file since you can clearly define who can access your database.
This database can help e-commerce websites understand product dynamics and give insights to 
marketing teams to curate content towards their target audience which can improve product 
sales, this can also help resolve customer issues as well as pinpoint the problem which can help 
retain old customers and gain new customers
